# Contributing

üëç üéâ Thanks for taking the time to contribute!
There are a lot of different ways to contribute to this project. See below for
everything you can do and the processes to follow for each contribution method.
Note that no matter how you contribute, your participation is governed by our
[Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Github Flow

We use [Github Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow), so all code changes happen through Pull Requests

How to do a pull request:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed important flows, update the documentation.
4. Make sure your code lints.
5. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](../LICENSE) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

- You can run `yarn lint` for style unification

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/freshgiammi-lab/supercharged-next/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
  - What you expected would happen
  - What actually happens
- Steps to reproduce (be specific!)
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People _love_ thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

## License
